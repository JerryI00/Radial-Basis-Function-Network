# Radial-Basis-Function-Network
A python implement of radial basis function network (RBFN), which can accept multi-variable input.
## The dependencies:
* python3
* scikit-learn
## Notes
  1. **How to specify the centers is the most difficult**. I specify the centers with clustering centers. ( So you can use any clustering algorithm to get the centers. )
  2. **The scale length of each radial basis function can be different.** But I set the scale length of each radial basis function with same value.
